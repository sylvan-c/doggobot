# doggobot
Bot which sends emails with dog pics

Installation:<br>
```git clone https://github.com/sylvan-c/doggobot```

You'll need to set up neomutt with your email address for this to work. I used mutt-wizard (https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard) and it worked fine for a gmail account. 

You also need to go into the files and change the recipient email address in the neomutt command in doggobot.sh
